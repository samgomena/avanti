## Combine Add and Edit Menu Functionality in Admin Console

- It's kinda annoying if you're adding something and realize you want/need to edit something and likewise if you're editing something and realize you want to add something.
- The edit and/or add pages should allow adding and/or editing the menu

## Edit menu admin page should allow filtering searching

- It's really annoying to scroll through all the stuff, especially if you're just updating one item

## Feature Flags

- ... ehh we should really just at the very least have some sort of rudimentary ff system in place. Rolling stuff out has been painful and so far most of this shit has only been tested locally manually or in prod

## Deployment history

- It's gonna be really annoying to handle rollbacks if there's no way to track changes across time. In the immediate term (i.e. when you're doing it) building features to encourage fixing forward would be beneficial but in the future we'll need a way to rollback
